// This is a test file

// This line is added from VSCode locally. and then pushed to github.

// Now I have renamed the repo name on github. I want to see if all the local setup still works. 
// So I am going to commit this two lines of code as is. No change locally

// This a commit from locally cloned project using new link - Repo-Original-Text-File

// And this commit is after pulling the changes to project cloned at the very beginning. 
// It is still able to get the new changes. And able to commit to the renamed repository.
